
## Jupyter Notebook Specification: LGD Model Development Lab

### 1. Notebook Overview

**Learning Goals:**

*   Understand the components of Loss Given Default (LGD) models, including Through-The-Cycle (TTC) and Point-In-Time (PIT) approaches.
*   Develop skills in data extraction, cleaning, and feature engineering for credit risk modeling.
*   Apply statistical modeling techniques to estimate LGD.
*   Learn how to incorporate macroeconomic factors into LGD models.
*   Evaluate model performance and prepare artifacts for deployment.

**Expected Outcomes:**

Upon completion of this lab, the user will be able to:

*   Calculate Realized LGD from loan-level data.
*   Perform exploratory data analysis to identify key LGD drivers.
*   Build TTC LGD models using appropriate regression techniques.
*   Create PIT overlays to adjust TTC LGDs based on macroeconomic conditions.
*   Assess model fit using relevant metrics and visualizations.
*   Prepare production-ready model artifacts.
