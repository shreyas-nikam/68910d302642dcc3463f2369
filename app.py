In this lab, we will explore Loss Given Default (LGD) models, covering both Through-The-Cycle (TTC) and Point-In-Time (PIT) approaches. LGD represents the expected loss when a borrower defaults on a loan.

**Learning Objectives:**

- Understand the key components of LGD models.
- Develop data extraction, cleaning, and feature engineering skills for credit risk modeling.
- Apply statistical modeling techniques to estimate LGD.
- Learn how to incorporate macroeconomic factors into LGD models for PIT adjustments.
- Evaluate model performance and prepare artifacts for deployment.

**Formulae:**

- **LGD (Loss Given Default):**  $\text{LGD} = 1 - \text{Recovery Rate}$
- **Recovery Rate:**  $\frac{\text{Recoveries}}{\text{Exposure at Default (EAD)}}$
